# limpy

Limber API library client for python.
Built using the [`openapi-python-client`](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client).

The OpenAPI specification YAML available for download at the [Limber documentation](https://card.limbersoftware.com.br/assets/open-api/integracao-de-vendas.html) is broken.
The build was made after corrections specified in the [report on the incorrect implementation of the OpenAPI spec](./issues/1.md).

The original spec is available as [`gerenciamento-de-vendas.yaml`](./openapi/gerenciamento-de-vendas.yaml) in this repository. The corrected YAML used for building limby can be found in [`openapi-specs`](./openapi/openapi-specs.yaml).

The auto-generated documentation for the API client's [README](./limpy/README.md).
